\# Flask Performance Test



This repository contains a simple \*\*Flask application\*\* used to compare performance between two environments:



1\. \*\*Docker container\*\*  

2\. \*\*Virtual Machine (VM)\*\* using Vagrant and VirtualBox  



The goal is to benchmark startup time, CPU usage, memory usage, and throughput to highlight differences between containerization and virtualization.

\## Run with Docker

Build and start the container:

```bash

docker build -t flask-perf-test .

docker run -p 5001:5000 flask-perf-test

The application will be available at:

\## Run with Docker

vagrant up

vagrant ssh

cd /vagrant

python3 app.py



The application will be available at:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/health
